# Graphene Bandstructure Learning

This repository provides an **introductory** guide for students and researchers learning about **graphene** and its electronic properties. It contains computational notebooks, JSON datasets, and symmetric k-paths used to generate bandstructure visualizations across different graphene stackings.

For a deeper, interactive explanation of the tight-binding calculations and experimental methodologies with figures, sliders, and detailed notes, visit the companion website:

## Overview

Graphene is a two-dimensional carbon material whose electronic properties depend strongly on its **layer number** and **stacking order**.  
This repository includes computational examples for:

- **Monolayer graphene (1L)**
- **Bilayer graphene (2L) – AB (Bernal)**
- **Trilayer graphene (3L) – ABA (Bernal)**
- **Trilayer graphene (3L) – ABC (Rhombohedral)**

Each notebook contains:

- Bandstructure plots
- Code to calculate interlayer-potential tuned tight-binding Hamiltonians  
- Visualizations of dispersion along high-symmetry paths and in 3D 

All plots are generated using Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib/Plotly, depending on the notebook).
